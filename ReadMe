I recently completed an analysis on Python, using Data from Winter and Summer Olympics. First, I imported the necessary libraries and read in two csv files,
one for the Winter Olympics and one for the Summer Olympics. Using the head() function in pandas, I was able to preview the first few rows of the data.

Next, I used the seaborn library to create countplots of the gender of participants in both the Winter and Summer Olympics. This allowed me to quickly 
visualize the distribution of male and female participants in each event.

After that, I used the info() function to check for any missing data and to get an overview of the data types for each column. 

I then concatenated the Winter and Summer Olympics data into a single dataframe and used the value_counts() function to analyze the data by different 
categories such as country, sport and athlete.

I found that the USA has the most participants in both the Winter and Summer Olympics and Aquatics has had the most Olympians since 1924, 
followed by Athletics and Rowing. I also observed that 87.2% of the overall metals of Athletics are from the Athletics segment. According to the Olympic 
Website, Athletics is "Athletics is a group of track and field events covering a wide variety of sports, with competitions featuring running, walking, 
jumping and throwing under different disciplines."

Furthermore, USA has the most metals in Aquatics, followed by Athletics, followed by Austria in Aquatics.

Lastly, I found that Michael Phelps has the most metals all time with 22. This analysis demonstrates the power of using Python and its libraries to 
efficiently analyze and visualize large datasets.
